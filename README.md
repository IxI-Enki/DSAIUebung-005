- ***Hello History***:
  - is heavily based torwards a "woke" & "political correct" audience - which feels VERRY OFF while "talking" to historic figures;  
  - Also you can "talk" to Mao, Stalin and other horrible individuals, but same is NOT TRUE for anyone not on the far left; 
  - You would have a hard time finding anyone on the right political spectrum to text with;
  - Also no one would truthfully tell the bad stuff that they have done
    > - left is romanticized and always shown in good faith  
    > - right is not even present, or won't recognize their accurate thoughts  
        > ( like Nietzsche for example - he had written about the Ubermensch and other sick things, the AI won't even recognize this as his words )
    > - That's verry frustrating and feels like twisting history, in favour of a radical left D.E.I. agenda.

- ***DUST.tt***:
  - feels like a stolen CHatGPT-API - nothing more
  - With a hefty price-tag to it.
